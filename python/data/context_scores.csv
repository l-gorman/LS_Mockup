Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan),1,2,1,1,2,1,2,needs knowledge to avoid competition (semi-arid!); no fertilization; pigeon pea still sold

Bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris),2,3,1,2,3,2,2,"less land requirements in intercropping; less labour required than eg green grams; not difficult but susceptible to disease/pest; market site-dependent: in Kenya would not be grown without market (or less), but in DRC/Rwanda... also grown w/o market just for food"
Groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea L.),4,4,1,3,3,2,1,"more than groundnut, eg shelling, also digging them up; uses fertilizer (P) and inoculum; knowledge intensive (ridges and soil adding at flowering in Ethiopia but not in Uganda)"

Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) ,3,2,3,2,2,1,4,"labour for chopping (green manure); many people don't know it, but management is easy; mucuna adoption commonly constrained by land availability; investment in soil quality only if cash crop can benefit from it"

Crotolaria juncea,2,3,2,2,2,2,3,
Calliandra calothyrus,1,1,3,1,2,2,3,"land requirements low if as fence and spot; cutting, chopping, feeding takes labour; some initial input and labour (nursery) but after establishment hardly any; indirect market for milk "
